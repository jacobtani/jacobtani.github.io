           <p> Hey! I'm Tania, a 24 year old Ruby on Rails Developer in the Mobile Apps and Rails (MARS) team at Datacom. I have been at Datacom since May 2012 and started there as an intern in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand team. After graduating, I was a Java Developer within the team and stayed in this team for one year. The application I was working on was the ESAS-NZClear application - a real time gross settlement transaction system for New Zealand. More recently, over the past four months I have been working as a Web Developer working on multiple small to medium sized projects. I have found Web Development to be an area I would like to pursue further. </p>
