           <p> I am a 24 year old Developer working at Datacom Systems Wellington. I describe myself as a motivated individual who is keen to learn new skills and grasps any opportunity that is presented. I have worked in both waterfall (Java) and agile (Ruby on Rails) environments as well as in a DevOps team. At this stage I want to develop my expertise in Ruby on Rails. This is because working in the field has been the highlight of my career. Presently I am working on multiple Ruby on Rails applications in my spare time to build my skill set and grow my confidence in the domain. The applications I am working on in my spare time can be found using the following links for your reference:
